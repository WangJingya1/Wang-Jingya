## Experience
Although I have no formal full-time work experience, I once had an internship in Changchun North Lake School. This internship experience was very valuable to me. It gave me my first experience of the charm and responsibility of the profession of teacher. During the internship, I actively participated in the auxiliary work of classroom teaching, assisting the lecturer to prepare courseware, organize class activities and correct students' homework. Through close contact with students, I learned how to patiently answer their questions, how to impart knowledge in a lively and interesting way, so as to stimulate their interest in learning.
